## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This simple web application allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe in your web browser.

## How to Play

1. Open the web page in your browser.
2. The game starts with "X" as the first player. Click on any empty cell (button) to place your symbol.
3. The game will alternate between "X" and "O" for each move.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Game Rules

- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The game will automatically announce the winner or declare a draw when appropriate.
- You can start a new game by refreshing the web page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the game board.
- CSS: Applied for styling and layout.
- JavaScript: Implemented the game logic and interactivity.
